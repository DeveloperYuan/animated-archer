** Problem Description

   Job shop scheduling is an optimization problem in which n jobs J1,
   J2, ..., Jn of varying sizes are given. These jobs need to be
   scheduled on m identical machines, while trying to minimize the
   makespan. The makespan is the total length of the schedule (that
   is, when all the jobs have finished processing).

** Problem Formulation
*** Variables
    - n, number of Jobs
    - m, number of identical Machine
    - J, an array of each Jobs' weight
    - S, an array of each Jobs' Schedule
*** Constraints
    - m > 1
    - n > m
    - \forall s \in S, 1 <= s <= m
*** Cost Function

    Time takes the longest scheduled machine to finish. See cost.m

*** Goals
    - Minimize cost function
    - Minimize number of iterations for each algorithm
    - Find the best algorithm for the problem
*** Simple Example
    - J = (2,3,4,6,2,2)
    - S = (1,2,2,3,1,1)
    - Cost = 7
    - This setup is optimal
** Tabu Search

** Simulated Annealing
*** Neighbors of each schedule

    Each schedule will have (m-1)*n neighbors, where m is the number
    of machines, and n is the number of jobs. Neighbors will only have
    one job scheduled on a different machine.

*** Finding a suitable start temperature
    - Assume the max change is the MAX of
      - total time of all job divide by number of machines.
      - max time of a single job.
    - Formula to find the max
      - Temp_start = -1 * max_change / ln(p_0), where p_0 is 0.85
    - Start temperature is not calculated within SA, need to be
      calculated before execute the SA.
      - see "findStartTemp" in "SA_test.m".
*** Cooling Schedule
    - Using geometric cooling schedule.
    - Final temperature should close to zero but not equal to zero.
    - alpha = 0.75 ~ 0.9 is commonly used.
    - iteration
      - a constant.
      - number of iteration for each temperature.
